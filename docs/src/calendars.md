# Calendars

Stave builds _calendars_ out of different sets of Events. Stave calendars make it easy for you to show the Events that matter to you, wherever you already manage your calendars.

> [!NOTE]
> Stave calendars show you Events, not Games. If you're only staffed for some parts of an Event, your calendar will still show the entire Event.

## Adding Stave Calendars

Stave calendars are provided in the form of a link that you can subscribe to wherever your existing calendar lives. When a calendar is available, you'll see a bold "Add to calendar" button in Stave. Click the button to see your calendar link and instructions for how to subscribe.

Most email applications and providers support subscribing to calendars.
