# Funding and Support

Stave is built and supported by [Stacktrace](https://ktema.org).

Stave does not request or accept funding from roller derby leagues or volunteers. It will be free for the roller derby community for its lifetime.

Stacktrace commits to fund and operate Stave _at least_ through the end of 2029 (3 years). This commitment is intended to give leagues confidence in adopting the platform. This is a minimum commitment, with every intention of extending further.
