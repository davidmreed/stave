## LLM and Generative AI Development

Stave is not developed with LLMs or generative AI.

We acknowledge that contributors may have a variety of methodologies using generative AI assistance, such as generative AI code reviews.

We do not accept "vibe-coded" contributions, including code or assets that are created wholly or substantially by generative AI.
