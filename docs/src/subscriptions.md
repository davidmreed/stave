# Subscriptions

You likely work with the same leagues over and over. You can _subscribe_ to leagues to have Stave bring their events to your attention.

## What Subscriptions Do

Events from your subscriptions move to the top of your Open Applications list on the Stave homepage and in the full [Open Applications](https://stave.app/open-applications/) page.

Stave always shows you both subscribed and non-subscribed Events. Subscriptions come first, in date order, followed by non-subscriptions in date order. You'll see headers in the list to mark which events are from your subscriptions and which are not.

Your subscriptions also populate a [calendar](./calendars.md). Your subscriptions' calendar link is found on the [My Subscriptions](https://stave.app/my-subscriptions/) page. You can add this calendar to your calendar application of choice to see all your subscribed Leagues' Events.

## Managing Subscriptions

Subscribe to a League by clicking the Subscribe button next to its name. You'll see this button on every League page and on the [Leagues list](https://stave.app/leagues/) in Stave. You can click Unsubscribe to remove a League from your subscriptions.

Your subscriptions are summarized in the My Subscriptions pane on the Stave homepage. You can view all of your subscriptions on the [My Subscriptions](https://stave.app/my-subscriptions/) page, where you can also unsubscribe from any that you wish to remove.

## League Groups

League Groups represent a collection of Leagues that you can subscribe to as a whole. For exampe, regional consortia or leagues that share an officiating pool can be represented as League Groups. Subscribing to a League Group has the same effect as subscribing to each League independently, but your subscriptions will update automatically as the League Group is updated.

Anyone can create a League Group. You can choose whether to keep the group private, or share it with others. If you do not mark it private, your League Group will appear in Stave's [League Groups](https://stave.app/league-groups/) list, and other users can subscribe to it. You can add or remove Leagues at any time.

Every League Group's page shows a list of all the Events owned by its constituent Leagues. If the League Group is public, this page can be shared for reference.

League Groups get their own shared [calendars](./calendars.md). A League Group's calendar includes Events from every League in the League Group. You can use a League Group's calendar whether or not you subscribe to the League Group. If you do subscribe, the entire League Group is included in your subscriptions calendar.
