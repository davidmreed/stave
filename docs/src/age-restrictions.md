# Age Restrictions

Stave is available only to users who are at least 13 years old. **If you are under 13 years old, your parent or guardian must sign up on your behalf, using accounts (including email addresses) managed by the parent or guardian**.

If Stave becomes aware that a user is under the age of 13, the user account will be immediately deactivated and all personal information for that user destroyed.

This requirement is driven by legislation in the United States.
