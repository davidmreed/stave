# Support, Maintenance, and Funding

Stave is built and supported by [Stacktrace](https://ktema.org), with [contributions](./contributors.md) from other members of the derby tech community. Stave has a [Discord instance](https://discord.gg/jwYGPa2EAK) for discussion and support. [GitHub issues](https://github.com/davidmreed/stave) are available for bug reports and roadmap items.

Stave does not request or accept funding from roller derby leagues or volunteers. It will be free for roller derby for its lifetime.

As a volunteer labor of love, like all of roller derby, Stave comes with no guarantees and does not have the resources to provide 24/7 support or incident response. Stacktrace is committed to keeping Stave stable and usable. If you're planning to staff a large-scale, time-critical event on Stave, feel free to check in with Stacktrace for any concerns.

Stave is an open source application, which means that you can see and change its source code yourself and it cannot be controlled by a single entity. Stave is licensed under the [GNU Affero Public License](./license.md), which ensures that server-based applications like Stave remain open. You can contribute to Stave's development on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidmreed/stave).
