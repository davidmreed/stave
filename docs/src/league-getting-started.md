# Getting Started

You need your own Stave account before you get started with a league. If you don't already have an account, see [Signing Up](./signing-up-and-logging-in.md) first.

Stave gives you an opportunity to draft and experiment before any of your league data is publicly visible. Don't worry about getting everything exactly right on the first try; you can change it later, and nobody will see it until you're ready.

Start your league by visiting the Leagues page from the navigation bar, then click Create.

Stave offers you a choice of _templates_. Most leagues should choose the _Roller Derby League_ template. It will set up your league with a collection of Event Templates and Application Form Templates you can use to staff your events, plus the standard roller derby Role Groups for skating officials, nonskating officials, and tournament head officials. You can modify or delete the templated configuration at any time.

Choose not to use a template only if you want to do basic configuration yourself. You should know the [Key Concepts](./key-concepts.md) well if you want to follow this path.

Once you've chosen your template, fill out the information about your league. You'll be able to change this information later! To keep links consistent, choose a _slug_ you'll be happy with. It will form part of all of your league's event and application links. **Most leagues should use a lowercase form of the league name, separated by hyphens, as the slug. "Ceres Roller Derby" would use "ceres-roller-derby".**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Read the agreement at the bottom of the page, and read the entire Stave [privacy policy](./privacy-policy.md).** When you sign up a league, you're agreeing to use data submitted through Stave according to the privacy policy. We take data use, data retention, and user privacy **very seriously**, and we expect you to do the same.

Congratulations! You're now the manager of a league on Stave. The league is not yet _enabled_ (you'll see this noted in a banner when you view league pages), which means that nobody except you can see it. You're free to work on your league data, start drafting an event, and test out a sample form. Once you're ready to start using Stave with other people, just [email Stacktrace](mailto:david@ktema.org) to have your league enabled. And don't worry - you don't have to stay the _only_ manager of your league.

For now, head to the next chapter to learn about setting up your events and forms.
