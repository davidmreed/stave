# Signing Up and Logging In

## Creating Your Account

You can create your Stave account using either your email address or your Google account. Don't worry; you can change your mind about how you want to log in later. Start by clicking "Sign Up" in the navigation bar or on any Application Form.

If you use your email address and set a password, Stave will send you an email with a confirmation link. You need to click on that link to activate your account. If you use your Google account, Stave will use the email address associated with that account, and you won't need to confirm.

Once your account is confirmed, you can log in to Stave and apply to Events.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Stave is only available to users who are age 13 and older, even in the context of JRDA leagues. See our [Age Restrictions](./age-restrictions.md) for more information.

## The Stave Profile

Stave stores common application information in your profile so that you don't need to retype it every time. When you complete an application, your profile data will be pre-filled, and any changes you make will automatically be saved in your profile for next time. Profile data is always the first section in an application.

You can view and edit your profile information at any time by clicking My Account in the navigation bar.

## Email Addresses and Social Logins

You can log in to your Stave account using any combination of email address and third party accounts (social logins, like your Google account).

Use the "Manage Email Addresses" tab under My Account to add or update your email address. If you add a new email address, you'll need to click a confirmation link in an email to activate it. If you started with your Google account, Stave prepopulated the associated email address for you.

To connect or disconnect Google accounts from your Stave account, use the "Manage Social Login" tab under My Account. You can associate any number of Google accounts to your Stave account. You're free to remove Google accounts if you would prefer to log in with your email address and password.

## Setting or Changing Your Password

Use the "Change Password" tab under My Account to change your password, or to set a password if you created your Stave account with a Google account.

## Two-Factor Authentication

Stave supports passkeys for two-factor authentication. Add a passkey to your account with the "Add Passkey" tab under My Account. When you have a passkey configured, you'll need to use the passkey as a second factor after logging in with your username and password. You can also log in using your passkey directly by clicking "Sign in with a passkey" on any login page.

Passkey support looks different on every operating system and device. Check the documentation for your devices to see how it works for you, and consider adopting a dedicated password manager with the ability to store and sync passkeys.
