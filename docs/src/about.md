# About Stave

[Stave](https://stave.app/) provides event and volunteer management by and for roller derby: staff your derby games and tournaments, build application forms, communicate with officials and other volunteers, and maintain a calendar.

Stave is a new application and is in <strong>beta</strong> status, meaning it's being actively developed and tested and may have bugs.

Stave is [free and open source](https://github.com/davidmreed/stave). It is available under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](./license.md). Stave is built in Python with Django.

Stave welcomes contributions of code, documentation, bug reports, and feature requests. Learn more about how Stave is [maintained, funded, and supported](./support-maintenance-and-funding.md).
