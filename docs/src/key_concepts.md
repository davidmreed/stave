# Key Concepts

Stave is highly configurable to suit the staffing processes used by a variety of different leagues and organizations. If you're comfortable with Stave's out-of-the-box setup, start with the How To pages to learn how your organization an start staffing. If you'd like to go deeper or customize Stave to meet you unique needs, learn these key concepts first.

## Roles and Role Groups

Stave treats any slot where you can staff a person as a _Role_. Roles are organized into _Role Groups_: collections of Roles that are related and staffed together. For example, non-skating officials' Roles are part of a Role Group called _NSO_:

- HNSO
- JT
- PLT
- PLT
- SBO
- SK
- SK
- PBM
- PBT
- PBT
- ALTN

Note that there is one Role per person staffed, not one role per job a person does: two SK Roles, two PLT Roles, two PBT Roles.

Roles can be _exclusive_ or _nonexclusive_. Most Roles are exclusive, which means that a person staffed in that Role can't also do another Role. An IPR can't also be an SK! A few Roles are nonexclusive, which means that a person staffed in that Role can also hold another Role in the same Role Group. A HNSO can also be the JT, but can't be IPR.

## Events and Games

An Event is any activity for which you recruit and staff people. An Event can encompass any number of Games. A to-be-determined Event (no Games), a singleheader (one Game), a tripleheader (three Games), and a three-day tournament (16 Games) are all examples of Events.

Events are associated with one or more Role Groups, representing the set of Roles you want to staff for that Event.Role Groups can be linked to the Event, representing jobs that span the whole Event, or to Games, representing jobs done in each Game separately. For example, an OPR Role is filled on a per-Game basis, while a THNSO Role is filled on a per-Event basis.

An Event is always owned by a League. Users who have the Event Manager permission can create, update, and staff Events.

## Application Forms

When you build Application Forms and staff an Event, you do so based on Role Groups. For example, you'd typically have an Application Form that covers NSO and SO Roles, because those Roles are usually staffed as part of the same process. If you use Stave to staff other volunteer jobs, like photographers or announcers, those would be part of other Role Groups and have their own Application Forms.

There can only be one Application Form for each Role Group in an Event, but Application Forms can cover multiple Role Groups. For example, a tournament Event might have one Application Form for the SO and NSO Role Groups, and a separate Application Form for the THO Role Group.

### Availability Models

Application Forms can use three availability models to ask applicants what portions of the Event they can work:

- Entire Event. With this model, applicants are assumed to be available for the whole Event, whether it's two hours or two days.
- By Day. This model is for multi-day Events. Applicants select which day or days they are available, and can be staffed at any time on those days.
- By Game. This model is for multi-Game Events. Applicants select which Games they are available and can only be staffed for those Games, regardless of how many total Games or days are in the Event.

You can choose your availability model separately for each Application Form. Single-Game Events can only use the Entire Event model. One-day Events cannot use the By Day model.

### Application Processes

Stave offers two application processes.

- Assign Only. This process is typically used by smaller events. Applicants receive a schedule email when they are staffed. There is no confirmation process.
- Confirm, then Assign. This process is typically used by larger events and tournaments. Applicants are sent an invitation email when they are accepted. If they confirm their participation, they receive a schedule email when they are staffed.

You can choose the application process separately for each Application Form.
