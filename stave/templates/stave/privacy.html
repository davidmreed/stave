<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
This policy is intended to state in plain language what information Stave collects about you and how that information is used.
</p>

<h2>Personal Data</h2>
<p>
Stave's purpose is to manage data about events and volunteers. When you use Stave, you provide information about yourself to facilitate that purpose, such as your profile information, your applications to events, and leagues or events that you manage.
</p>
<p>
Stave uses this data only to accomplish its purpose. We do not use this data for unrelated purposes. We do not contact you for reasons unrelated to your use of the application.
</p>
<p>
When you apply to events with Stave, the league managing the event receives your application data. To use Stave, leagues must agree not to use data they receive in your applications for purposes that are not connected to your event participation or volunteer service. Leagues which misuse data may be removed from Stave, which is our and your only recourse against such misuse.
</p>
<p>
You should be aware that Stave's function is to connect leagues, events, and volunteers. That means that your application information, including contact information, your profile information, and your answers to other application questions, may be seen by personnel at the receiving league and in some cases (such as schedules) by other volunteers.
</p>
<p>
Stave will not disclose your personal data to any other entities than those described above, unless served with a valid legal order to do so. If we are compelled by law to disclose information, we will notify you if we are permitted. As of 2025-03-24, Stave has never made such a disclosure.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
Stave uses cookies to allow you to log into the site. We do not use cookies for other purposes. We do not track you on other sites, nor allow other sites to track you on Stave, other than as discussed in this policy.
</p>
<p>
If you do not wish to receive cookies, do not log in to Stave.
</p>
<h2>Third-Party Social Logins</h2>
<p>
Stave allows you to use your Google account to log in. If you do so, the account provider may track information about you and use that information subject to their privacy policies. Stave does not disclose your personal data (as discussed above) to these third-party account providers.
</p>
<p>
If you use a social account to login, Stave will record basic information about you (such as your name and email address), as offered by your account provider. We use that information just like your other personal data.
</p>
<h2>Automatic Data</h2>
<p>
When you interact with Stave, some information is automatically recorded in the form of server and error logs. These logs may contain information like (but not limited to):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your computer's IP address.</li>
    <li>Your Stave username, if you have one.</li>
    <li>The dates and times you interact with Stave.</li>
    <li>Any errors that you encounter while using Stave.</li>
</ul>
<p>We strive to avoid or minimize inclusion of personal data in these logs, but it may occur inadvertently.</p>
<p>
This information is used to maintain Stave and to respond to issues with the application. It may be stored and processed by Stave's providers, including but not limited to Railway, Sentry, and Cloudflare. We try to limit both the scope and the retention of this information wherever possible. However, some operations of our providers are not under our control and may retain this type of automatic data at their own discretion.
</p>
<h2>Ownership Changes</h2>
<p>
Should Stave change ownership or governance, the new operators will be required to follow the same policies shown here. Stave will not transfer data to new operators without such commitment.
</p>
<p>
Should Stave end operation, personal data stored by the application will be securely destroyed.
</p>
